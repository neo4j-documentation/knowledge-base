In 3.5 an entity (node, relationship, path) could be acquired in one transaction and safely reused by another.

However, in 4.0 these entities do hold a reference to their originating transaction. 

The problem might occur in any APOC calls that open new transactions, e.g. apoc.periodic.iterate (and couple more). 
Anything you hand over from the driving statement must be rebound in the action statement.

This means that we basically need to rebind entities that originate in a different transaction.

Rebinding means, doing a `MATCH (n) WHERE id(n) = id(myKnownNode)`.

As an example, the following statement would work perfectly in 3.5.x:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate('MATCH (:Account)-[r:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->() RETURN r',
    'CALL apoc.do.case(.....) YIELD value RETURN value',
     {batchSize: 10000, parallel: false, iterateList: true});
----

But, in 4.0.x, the above statement will need to be modified as:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate('MATCH (:Account)-[r:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->() RETURN id(r) as id',
    'MATCH ()-[r]->() WHERE id(r)=id CALL apoc.do.case(.....) YIELD value RETURN value', 
    {batchSize: 10000, parallel: false, iterateList: true});
----

Note that in the first (outer statement), we changed `RETURN r` to `RETURN id(r) as id`. 

In the second (inner statement), we inserted `MATCH ()-[r]->() WHERE id(r)=id` before the `CALL apoc.do.case()`.
