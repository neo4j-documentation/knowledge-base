This is usually as a result of either a bad certificate recorded at the client or incorrect url for the browser.

For example, as depicted from the screenshot and when using Google Chrome Browser and clicking on the padlock icon next to the url

you should see that this reports `Certificate Valid`.

Further if you click the text for `Certificate Valid` it should report similar to

and describe to which domain the certificate is `Issued to:`


If you encounter the error described above you should validate that your Neo4j Client has a valid certificate and replace at the client if not correct.
