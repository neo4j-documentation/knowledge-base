Prior to running a `match .... detach delete n;` which will find said nodes and delete all relationships associated with said nodes as well as delete the nodes themselves one might want to run a query to determine how many nodes/relationships will be effected.

For example, using the `:play movies` database as part of the Neo4j Browser, if one runs

[source,cypher]
----
match (n:Person) return count(n), sum ( size( (n)-[]->()));
----

this will report back

which would indicate that if you are to then run  `match (n:Person) detach delete n;` this will effect 

133 nodes and 253 relationships and as depicted

In this case the 133 nodes and 253 relationships is not a significantly large number.  
However if the query wass to return tens of thousands of nodes and relationships to be effected one should reconsider the approach and follow the document entitled `Large Delete Transaction Best Practices in Neo4j`
