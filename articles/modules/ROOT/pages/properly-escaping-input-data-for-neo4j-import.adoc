[NOTE]
`neo4j-import` is intended to populate a new, empty database.
It cannot be used to import into an existing database.

When importing data using `neo4j-import`, make sure to review the required CSV file structure and considerations before moving on.

== Escaping commas within the CSV:

[NOTE]
This applies to escaping any delimiter you use in place of a comma, if specified.
Neo4j only supports single character delimiters.

Consider the following string: `Use the force, Luke!`

If you want import this field to into neo4j from a CSV file, you must escape that comma.
The standard way to do this is to simply wrap quotes around the field.
`neo4j-import` will know that everything within un-escaped quotes belongs to the same field.

CSV file:
[source,csv]
----
:ID,:LABEL,movie,line
1,Movie,Star Wars,"Use the force, Luke!"
----

.Import into empty database:
[source,shell]
----
neo4j-import --into data/graph.db.1 --nodes simple_escape_test.csv
----

.Verify using Cypher:
[source,shell]
----
neo4j-sh (?)$ match (n:Movie) return n.line;
 +------------------------+
 | n.line                 |
 +------------------------+
 | "Use the force, Luke!" |
 +------------------------+
 1 row
----

Now, what if we want to include multiple lines in an array for a single movie node?

Escaping the array delimiter within the CSV:

Consider the following array: `{[Use the force, Luke!], [Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope.]}`

If you want import this array into a node property in neo4j from a CSV file, you must choose a single character delimiter that cannot exist within the array.
The default is the semi-colon character.
However, that won't work in our example!
We can easily substitute something like a pipe (|) character, but if you may have these in the data, you will need to find something more obscure, such as §.

.CSV file:
[source,csv]
----
:ID,:LABEL,movie,lines:string[]
1,Movie,Star Wars,"Use the force, Luke!§Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope."
----

.Verify using Cypher:
[source,shell]
----
neo4j-sh (?)$ match (n:Movie) return n;
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | n                                                                                                         |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Node[0]{movie:"Star Wars",lines:["Use the force, Luke!","Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope."]} |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 1 row
----

NOTE: The header for a string array column needs to have `:string[]`, which is case sensitive.
