The easiest way to determine the size of your graph is through the filesystem and summing up the size of the files named `\*store.db*`.
For example on linux implementations one can run

[source,shell]
----
du -hc $NEO4J_HOME/data/databases/graph.db/*store.db*
----

and this should be run on a stopped database or one which has recently checkpointed (i.e. immediately after backup)

and this will produce output similar to

[source,shell]
----
5.5M    neostore.labelscanstore.db
8.0K    neostore.labeltokenstore.db
4.0K    neostore.labeltokenstore.db.id
8.0K    neostore.labeltokenstore.db.names
4.0K    neostore.labeltokenstore.db.names.id
72M     neostore.nodestore.db
4.0K    neostore.nodestore.db.id
8.0K    neostore.nodestore.db.labels
4.0K    neostore.nodestore.db.labels.id
196M    neostore.propertystore.db
8.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.arrays
4.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.arrays.id
4.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.id
8.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.index
4.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.index.id
8.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.index.keys
4.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.index.keys.id
8.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.strings
4.0K    neostore.propertystore.db.strings.id
8.0K    neostore.relationshipgroupstore.db
4.0K    neostore.relationshipgroupstore.db.id
0       neostore.relationshipstore.db
4.0K    neostore.relationshipstore.db.id
0       neostore.relationshiptypestore.db
4.0K    neostore.relationshiptypestore.db.id
8.0K    neostore.relationshiptypestore.db.names
4.0K    neostore.relationshiptypestore.db.names.id
8.0K    neostore.schemastore.db
4.0K    neostore.schemastore.db.id
273M    total
----

To which the final line reports that the total size of the graph is 273M.   This does not include the size of the Neo4j 
transaction logs (neostore.transaction.*) but that is because the size of these files and retention is user configurable.

In the above listing the output was taken from a graph which contained 5 million nodes all with the label `:Person` and each node
had a property named `id` and it was a value from 1 to 5 million.   This data was prepared by running the equivalent of

[source,cypher]
----
        USING PERIODIC COMMIT 50000
        LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///person.csv' AS row
        CREATE (:Person { id: row.id}  );
----

Because of this you will see that the neostore.labelscanstore*, neostore.nodestore* and neostore.propertystore* files consume more than 
their default space.   Since the graph has no relationship the files named neostore.relationship* are effectively empty.

It should be obvious that as you add data the files will grow in size.   However there is one caveat to this which could explain why 
adding more data actually results in your database size decreasing.

In the above file listing the files ending in .id, for example `neostore.nodestore.db.id`, serve as a recycle bin of
IDs which are eligible for re-use.   As the graph was simply populated with 5 million :Person nodes, and nothing
was deleted the `neostore.nodestore.db.id` is empty and the nodes are recorded in `neostore.nodestore.db`.
However, if we were to then delete all 5 million nodes, we will see that the size of `neostore.nodestore.db` does not decrease but
`neostore.nodestore.db.id` increases to a size of 39M.   And as a result of this delete, we see that the total graph size has
increased by at least 39M.    Now if we were to re-insert the 5 million nodes, then the size of `neostore.nodestore.db.id` will 
decrease because as new nodes are added we first check to see if we can re-use an ID that was previously in use and if so we remove it
from the `neostore.nodestore.db.id`.    Since the `neostore.nodestore.db.id` had 5 million ids which could be re-used and since we
added 5 million nodes, then this file would be near empty (i.e. 4.0 K) upon completion.    By adding these nodes, which 
reduced the size of `neostore.nodestore.db.id` from 39M to 4.0k the total database size also decreased in the same fashion.
Note the size of `neostore.nodestore.db` has not changed in this experience.

In summary the experience is as follows relative to these 2 files (and with file size capture after a `neo4j stop`)

* step 1: empty graph
+
----
0       neostore.nodestore.db
4.0K    neostore.nodestore.db.id
----

* step 2:  add 5 million :Person nodes
+
----
72M     neostore.nodestore.db
4.0K    neostore.nodestore.db.id
----

* step 3:  remove 5 million :Person nodes  (i.e. `+CALL apoc.periodic.commit("match (n:Person) with n limit {limit} delete n return
count(*)",{limit:50000});+`)   -- at which point the graph is now empty
+
----
72M     neostore.nodestore.db
39M     neostore.nodestore.db.id
----

* step 4: re-add the 5 million :Person nodes
+
----
72M     neostore.nodestore.db
4.0K    neostore.nodestore.db.id
----


Now if you had reached step #3 above and did not plan to add more nodes but wanted to shrink the size of the files you 
will want to consider using https://github.com/jexp/store-utils[copy-store.sh].   This utility will read a offline 
database and copy out the data and not include any of the overhead of either data written but no longer in use or the list of 
eligible IDs to re-use.

After running copy-store.sh against the graph (as it existed at the completion of step #3 above) so as to prepare a new graph 
the resultant newly created graph.db now defined the 2 files as

----
0       neostore.nodestore.db
4.0K    neostore.nodestore.db.id
----
