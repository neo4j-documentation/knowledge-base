== Load JSON Documents into Neo4j with Cypher

Sometimes you want to load JSON from an API or file directly into Neo4j.

When doing that, it makes sense to map the JSON document structure into a cleaner graph model without data duplication.

As JSON has little "schema" information about the "types" and their constraints, we will use a Cypher statement to map it into the graph.

Imagine you have this JSON in a file named `person.json`.

[source,json]
----
{"name":"Jane", "age": 35, "children":[{"name":"Fred", "age":12},{"name":"Emma","age":8}]} 
----

It contains a `:Person` with a `name` and `age` property.
The `name` is our key.
And it's children which are `:Person`'s too and the same properties.

We create an constraint first:


[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE;
----

Then we can use this Cypher statement to map the JSON into the graph using a `+{json}+` parameter.

[source,cypher]
----
// get-or-create the parent-person
MERGE (parent:Person {name:{json}.name}) ON CREATE SET parent.age = {json}.age

// turn children array into stream of childData values
UNWIND {json}.children as childData

// get-or-create the child-person
MERGE (child:Person {name:childData.name}) ON CREATE SET child.age = childData.age

// get or create the parent->child relationship
MERGE (parent)-[:HAS_CHILD]->(child)

// return parent with all it's children, this line is optional
RETURN parent, collect(child) as children;
----

You can pass the JSON parameter via an API call of any driver of Neo4j.

Or for a one off, you can also use the REST commands in Neo4j Browser, like this:

[source,json]
----
:POST /db/data/transaction/commit {"statements":[{"statement":

"MERGE (parent:Person {name:{json}.name}) ON CREATE SET parent.age = {json}.age WITH parent UNWIND {json}.children as childData MERGE (child:Person {name:childData.name}) ON CREATE SET child.age = childData.age MERGE (parent)-[:HAS_CHILD]->(child)"

,"parameters":{"json":

{"name":"Jane", "age": 35, "children":[{"name":"Fred", "age":12},{"name":"Emma","age":8}]} 

}}]}
