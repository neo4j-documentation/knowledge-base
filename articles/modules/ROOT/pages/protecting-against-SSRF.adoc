== What is SSRF?

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities let an attacker send crafted requests from the back-end server of a vulnerable web application. Criminals usually use SSRF attacks to target internal systems that are behind firewalls and are not accessible from the external network.

SSRF vulnerabilities occur when an attacker has full or partial control of the request sent by the backend application.
SSRF is not limited to the HTTP protocol.
Generally the input that the attacker controls is HTTP, but the backend request could use different protocols.

You can practice attacking a vulnerable application and learn about mitigations in https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery/javascript/[this interactive lesson from Snyk^].

== Why SSRF attacks are relevant to the Neo4j ecosystem

Neo4j is a graph database that is used to analyse data.
To enable the users easy onboarding of the existing data, we have to provide ways to load files (typically CSV files) locally or from the network via http.
With that functionality comes the ability of a potentially malicious user to manipulate the initial request - step one of SSRF.

== How to protect my environment

Given that SSRF is an OWASP Top 10 issue, OWASP has a https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html[comprehensive guide to prevention and mitigation^].


The use case "users should be able to load the data from anywhere on the internet" falls into https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#case-2-application-can-send-requests-to-any-external-ip-address-or-domain-name[Case 2^], which is more complex to defend against.

But with a _defence in depth approach_, it is possible.

Neo4j does input validation as much as possible, which is your *application layer* defence. And if you build custom applications on top of Neo4j, it's a good idea to limit the ability to upload data and to run raw Cypher queries to your authenticated users.
But to ensure https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/defense_in_depth[_defence in depth_^], you should do more on the *network layer*.  

The detection and prevention are highly specific to your infrastructure and network environment.

=== Running on AWS cloud

Use https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/[IMDSv2^].

=== Running on Google cloud

Google has advisories for preventing access to https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/querying-metadata[metadata^], https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/protecting-resources-vpc-service-controls[Compute Engine resources^] and how to https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[utilize workload identity to minimize access^].

=== Generic mitigation

Segment your network and configure your firewall to prevent access from Neo4j to the metadata subnet (if running on cloud) and any other sensitive backend subnets.
In most cases you want to prevent access to internal IP addresses originating from the backend service in general.

== Configuration option

In addition to the external network-level restriction mechanisms listed above, Neo4j has an internal control mechanism which allows users to provide IP address ranges for the DBMS to block.
This control is activated via a configuration setting which must be added to https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/neo4j-conf[neo4j.conf^] and
requires restarting the DBMS to be applied.

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| **Description** | IP address ranges used by the DBMS to block IP requests
| **Valid values** | Comma separated list of IPv4 and IPv6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation[CIDR-notation^] IP ranges
| **Default value** |
|===

When the DBMS attempts to make an IP request to a URL, after resolving the URL to an IP address, it ensures this address doesn't collide with any
of the blocked IP ranges provided by the configuration setting. Because the control mechanism is applied at the IP network level, it will be applied to any HTTP and FTP requests made by Cypher features
such as https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.4/clauses/load-csv/[LOAD CSV^].

There are several helpful resources one could use to help calculate their required blocklist. One such resource is
https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr[ipaddressguide.com^] which has calculators for both https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr[IPv4 CIDR^] and
https://www.ipaddressguide.com/ipv6-cidr[IPv6 CIDR^] ranges.

=== Use cases
This section includes some example to help illustrate how the setting can be used in practice.

[cols="1"]
|===
| **unsupported.dbms.cypher_ip_blocklist=**
| Blocks no traffic (default behaviour).
|===

[cols="1"]
|===
| **unsupported.dbms.cypher_ip_blocklist=0.0.0.0/0,::/0**
| Blocks all IPv4 and IPv6 network traffic.
|===

[cols="1"]
|===
| **unsupported.dbms.cypher_ip_blocklist=10.0.0.0/8,ff:f::/64**
| Blocks IPv4 traffic between 10.0.0.0 and 10.255.255.255. +
Blocks IPv6 traffic between ff:f:0:0:0:0:0:0 and ff:f:0:0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff.
|===

[cols="1"]
|===
| **unsupported.dbms.cypher_ip_blocklist=10.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/24**
| Blocks IPv4 traffic between 10.0.0.0 and 10.255.255.255. +
Blocks IPv4 traffic between 255.0.0.0 and 255.0.0.255. +
Blocks no IPv6 traffic.

=== Supported Versions
In Neo4j, the setting is available from versions https://neo4j.com/release-notes/database/neo4j-4-4-4[4.4.4^],
https://neo4j.com/release-notes/database/neo4j-4-3-17[4.3.17^],
https://neo4j.com/release-notes/database/neo4j-4-2-19[4.2.19^],
https://neo4j.com/release-notes/database/neo4j-4-1-12[4.1.12], and
https://neo4j.com/release-notes/database/neo4j-3-5-35[3.5.35^].

In APOC, the setting is available from versions https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/tag/4.4.0.3[4.4.0.3^],
https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/tag/4.3.0.8[4.3.0.8^],

Although the name will change to `internal.dbms.cypher_ip_blocklist`, the setting will also be supported in the upcoming
5.0 releases for both Neo4j and APOC.
