== Incorrect file permissions on store files

It is common to start the database as different users, this can leave store files owned by other user ids.  
( e.g. root )

In such case, you might want to fix the store files and directory. For example : `+${NEO4J_HOME}/data/databases/graph.db/+`

== Disk space is full

2 possible cases:

- If you are running Neo4j version earlier than 3.4, please reach out to support.  

- From Neo4j version 3.5, you should be able to recover by clearing up some space and restarting the affected node.
