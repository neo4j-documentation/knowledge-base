Neo4j 3.4 saw the https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-graph-database-3-4-ga-release/[introduction of the temporal date type^], and while there is now powerful in built functionality, converting strings to dates is still a challenge.

If our string is in the format `yyyy-MM-dd` we can call the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/temporal/date/index.html[`date`^] function with that string and have it converted to a date automatically:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN date("2019-06-04") AS date
----

Executing this query will return the following result:

[opts="header"]
|====
|date
|"2019-06-04"
|====

But what if our string is in a different format, say `dd/MM/yyyy`?
Let's try and create a date from such a string:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN date("04/06/2019") AS date
----

Executing this query will return the following result:

....
Text cannot be parsed to a Date
"04/06/2019"
 ^
....

One way we can solve this problem is by manually parsing our string into its different components using the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/3.5/functions/string/#functions-split[`split`^] function.
We can then create a date from those components:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH [item in split("20/07/2018", "/") | toInteger(item)] AS dateComponents
RETURN date({day: dateComponents[0], month: dateComponents[1], year: dateComponents[2]}) AS date
----

Executing this query will return the following result:

[opts="header"]
|====
|date
|"2018-07-20"
|====

Alternatively we can use the APOC library's https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/overview/apoc.date/apoc.date.parse/[`apoc.date.parse`^] function to massage our data into a supported format.
This function gives us a flexible way for handling different date and time patterns.

The following query:

* Uses the `apoc.date.parse` function to convert our `dd/MM/yyyy` date string into a timestamp in milliseconds
* Creates a datetime from that timestamp
* Creates a date from that datetime

[source,cypher]
----
WITH apoc.date.parse("31/05/2019", "ms", "dd/MM/yyyy") AS ms
RETURN date(datetime({epochmillis: ms})) AS date
----


Executing this query will return the following result:

[opts="header"]
|====
|date
|"2019-05-31"
|====

We could also use this function to parse a longer date format:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH apoc.date.parse("Tue, 10 September 2019", "ms", "EEE, dd MMMMM yyyy") AS ms
RETURN date(datetime({epochmillis: ms})) AS date
----

Executing this query will return the following result:

[opts="header"]
|====
|date
|"2019-09-10"
|====
