When using `$NEO4J_HOME/bin/cypher-shell` at the command line and authentication is enabled via the setting `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf`:

[source,conf]
----
# Whether requests to Neo4j are authenticated.
# To disable authentication, uncomment this line
dbms.security.auth_enabled=true
----

a username and password can be provided on the command line using the parameters `-u <username> -p <password>`. However, one can
also define environment variables `NEO4J_USERNAME` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, for example:

[source,shell]
----
export NEO4J_USERNAME='neo4j'
export NEO4J_PASSWORD='password'
----

Once the environment variables are defined one can now run `$NEO4J_HOME/bin/cypher-shell` and not specify the -u and -p 
on the command line. This has the added benefit that when running the linux 'history' command, which shows the last N command line
invocations, the username and password will not be exposed.

Further if using linux, the export commands above could be placed in the user's home directory in their `.bashrc` file (for example
/home/neo4j/.bashrc) and for which the `.bashrc` is invoked upon initial login.

If using Windows, environment variables can be defined via Control Panel -> System, Advanced tab, [Environment Variables] as 
pictured below:
